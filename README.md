Title: Optimized package delivery program

Purpose: This program was made to plan truck routes for a package delivery service. Given a list of addresses, distance between addresses, and special delivery notes for packages, this program plans the routes of the trucks that keeps the total distance driven under 140 miles and delivers all the packages before 5:00PM. In this simulated scenario, the trucks drive a constant speed and time taken to load and unload packages is not included. The nearest neighbor algorithm is used to calculate an efficient truck route. Good knowledge in data structures, algorithms, python, and problem solving were needed to create this project.
